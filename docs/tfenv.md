## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An account with the cloud provider you plan to use (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
- Terminal or Command Prompt: You'll need a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

## 2. Installing tfenv

### On macOS and Linux:

1. Open a Terminal window.
2. Install `tfenv` using a package manager. For example, on macOS using Homebrew:

   ```sh
   brew install tfenv
   ```

   On Linux, you can use the following commands:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv.git ~/.tfenv
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.tfenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

## 3. Using tfenv

1. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you plan to work on your Terraform projects.

### Installing Specific Terraform Version

To install a specific version of Terraform using `tfenv`, run the following command:

```sh
tfenv install <terraform_version>
```

For example:

```sh
tfenv install 0.15.5
```

### Switching Between Installed Versions

To switch between different installed Terraform versions, use the following command:

```sh
tfenv use <terraform_version>
```

For example:

```sh
tfenv use 0.15.5
```

### Listing Installed Versions

You can list all the Terraform versions that are installed using `tfenv`:

```sh
tfenv list
```

### Automatically Switching Versions (Optional)

You can configure your project directory to automatically switch to a specific Terraform version by creating a `.terraform-version` file in the project directory. Inside the file, specify the desired Terraform version. When you navigate to that directory, `tfenv` will automatically switch to the specified version.

## 4. Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully installed `tfenv` and learned how to use it to manage multiple versions of Terraform on your system. This can be especially helpful when working on different projects that require different Terraform versions.

By using `tfenv`, you can avoid conflicts between projects with different version requirements and ensure a smooth development and deployment process.
